# BMP DOG
A throwback to the time I put a phone on my dog to collect BMP events.

**Backstory**

When I was maintaining an Akmai BMP solution, I needed to collect a large amount of events in order to train a model that would then generate realistic event datasets.
I used this code to collect the events by strapping the phone to my dog as he ran around all day. Another idea was to throw the phone in the washing machine and put in on a low spin cycle; this probably 
would have worked too given that the standard by which they judge events is not very high.

**Usage**

I wouldn't use this now as the code is outdated and it also collects on an interval that was for my own event acquisition purposes. It takes some work in order to turn what is collected into 
processable event dataset. At the time I would just load the project wirelessly from Android Studio onto my Pixel 4a and go to town collecting for sometimes hours at a time. 

**TLDR**

This was a fun experiment and project at the time; I find it very amusing that I used my dog to combat an anti-bot system and it just so happened to work. Please do not reference this or use this
for anything with ill intent. The repo is meant to be funny and interesting. Thank you!
